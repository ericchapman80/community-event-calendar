The express and cosmos portion was built based on inspriration from this repo: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/tutorial-nodejs-web-app

The goal is to integrate the event data from cosmos db into jquery-calendar - https://github.com/ArrobeFr/jquery-calendar

A working example of the jquery-calendar can be found under /public/example.html & demo.html
